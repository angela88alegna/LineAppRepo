# LineAppRepo
I have created a single page App with a switcher which enables the dark mode.
Each time the switcher is clicked, the click event is counted and added in the first input field.
Data can be added to the Data list with a button("Add data").
Data can also be deleted.
I decided to use Firebase as a Back|End database & NPM and Node JS to install the Firebase tools.
I decided to use Firebase database because data are stored in a JSON format, as required.
